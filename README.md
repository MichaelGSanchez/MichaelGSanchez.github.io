## Passion Project
###Career Change:
Changing careers is a task that in itself can be daunting, and filled with many other tasks itself. 
Before entering the tech field I worked in hospitality for 7 years.  Of those 7 years nearly four were spent in the world of sales. 
After my last stop, I knew that the career path that I had set myself on was not what I wanted. 
So I created a new project and that has been to create a new career path for myself. It has been not been
an easy transition.  However, is anything that is worthwhile ever easy?
